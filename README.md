# Zach Refunds
A smart contract to refund users via merkle-tree claims

The contract that is used in production is the solidity one, but @pcaversaccio contributed a vyper version of the contract as well. Please be aware that the vyper version is NOT tested and it has NOT been deployed in production, so use it at your own risk.
